# npm modules examples

As we already added lodash package to our project we will use it as an example
https://lodash.com/docs


```javascript 

const _ = require('lodash'); // this is how you import packages to your js file

_.forEachRight(users, function(user) {
    //do what you want with each user here
    // will iterates over elements of collection from right to left
});

```
